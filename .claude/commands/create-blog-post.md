# Create Blog Post

## Usage

```txt

```

## Description

Create a new blog post in Markdown with proper frontmatter. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new markdown file in `Sources/Bazaar/Markdown/` with a descriptive filename (e.g.,
   `new-feature-announcement.md`). **MANDATORY** always use lower kebab case.
2. Add YAML frontmatter with title, slug, description, and inserted_at
   (use current timestamp in ISO8601 format).
3. Run a Deep Research using your MCP Tools to get all the relevant facts for the blog post.
   **MANDATORY** if no Deep Research MCP server is available, refuse blog post creation and remove the .md file again.
4. Write the blog post content in Markdown with a clear title and engaging content. Write persuasive and warm.
5. Use Citations where possible, do not hallucinate! Only use information your deep-research has uncovered!
6. Include a "Created at" timestamp at the bottom in the format "*Created at: Month Day, Year*".
7. The blog post will automatically appear on the blog index page sorted by creation date (most recent first).
8. Ensure the slug in frontmatter matches the intended URL path for the blog post.
9. Run ./scripts/format-markdown.sh to format the markdown file and fix any changes.
